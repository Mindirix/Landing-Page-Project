* The navigation menu contains links to the correspondent sections of the landing page.
* A click on a section in the navigation bar triggers smooth scroll to anchor ID.
* A section that is in the viewport is highlighted by a different color and animation.
* Current section in the navigation bar is highlighted in green. Link on hoover is in black.
